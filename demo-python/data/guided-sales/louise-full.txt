1. How would you like to interact and communicate with your customer while specifying a vehicle?
In person, face to face
2. Describe how you build trust with your customer when creating an offer?
I spend time visiting and calling the customer at regular times to discuss their needs, and to follow-up
3. How do you secure that you offer a solution that match the customer needs?
I work hard on creating the specification in the VSS – and always call the customer to clarify and confirm that I have selected the correct variant/information for them
4. What do you include when selling a total offer to a customer?
Depending on the customer – I do share all available information on other products and services – but I mainly concentrate on contracts & finance
5. What do you experience being challenges when putting together a total offer?
Nothing – I am quite competent
6. What are the challenges when specifying a vehicle? (In VSS, WIS, PERF, ERS)
It’s all too complicated.... it takes far too much time, and I need to be out visiting the customers more, instead of being sat in the office doing administrative work.
7. How do you prefer to introduce the conversation about pricing?
Customers always talk about price at the beginning, so it’s aways there at the start and it’s hard to move them away from that conversation.
8. Describe your dream, how would you like to be supported when specifying a new vehicle?
The systems should be more intuitive and do a lot of things automatically for you. There are too many manual steps you must do.
9. Describe your dream process when putting together a total offer?
The process I use today is working fine for me.
